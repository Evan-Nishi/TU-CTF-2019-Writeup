## Hint \#2
>If the account or webpage you find doesn't have 'ctf' in/on it somehow, its a dead end

The first hint isn't entirely neccesary.  ONSINT refers to a framework that helps people find information.  Learn more about it [here](https://osintframework.com/).  If you use certain browsers like DuckDuckGo, and type in "Ophelia FlagDeCotour" into the search bar you'll find an Archive Your Own webpage as one of the first results: [Archive Your Own](https://archiveofourown.org/users/OpheliaFlagDeCotour/profile).  After a bit of snooping you should find the [tumblr](https://opheliawritesctfchals.tumblr.com/) page of the user.  Now you need to find a way to contact the user.  After a bit more snooping you should find the user's [email](opheliarealiamnot@gmail.com) address under "comission info".  Email the address any message and you'll get emailed the flag!
